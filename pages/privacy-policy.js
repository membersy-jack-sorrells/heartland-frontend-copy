            they make available to us.
          </li>
          <li>
            Personal information: In the course of providing services to you, we

            We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a
            transparent manner. We collect and process information about you
            only where we have legal bases for doing so. These legal bases
            depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we
            collect and use your information only where:
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are
              a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such
              a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request
              from us);
            </li>
            <li>
              it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by
              your data protection interests), such as for research and
              development, to market and promote our services to you, and to
              protect our legal rights and interests;
            </li>
            <li>
              you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose (for example,
              you might consent to us sending you a newsletter); or
            </li>
            <li>
              we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <li>
            Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific
            purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but
            this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).
          </li>
          <li>
            We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary.
            While we retain this information, we will protect it within
            commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as
            unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. If
            necessary, we may retain your personal information in order to
            comply with a legal obligation.

            organization. We use the following access safeguards to prevent
            unauthorized access to information stored on or transmitted by our

          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              internal access controls (so only limited personnel have access to

            </li>
            <li>
              training personnel on relevant security and compliance policies;

              protect against loss; and
            </li>

              securing information using security technologies like secure
              socket layer (SSL), encryption, firewalls, and secure passwords.

          If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response
          to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will
          deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your
          option.

        <p>
          Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period
          preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we
          provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request,
          if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format
          to provide your personal information that is readily useable and
          should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to
          another entity without hindrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
          consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
          unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will
          tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
          estimate before completing your request.

          <strong>The “Shine the Light” Law</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to your rights under the CCPA, California Civil Code
          Section 1798.83, or the “Shine the Light” law, permits any of our
          users who are California residents to request and receive, once a
          year, a notice describing the categories of personal customer
          information we share with unaffiliated third parties for their direct
          marketing purposes. The notice will identify the categories of
          information shared, the third parties and affiliates with which it was
          shared, and their names and addresses. If you are a California
          resident and would like a copy of the notice that the law requires,
          please submit a written request to: info@membersy.com . In your
          request, please specify that you want a “California Privacy Rights
          Notice.” Please allow at least thirty days for a response.
